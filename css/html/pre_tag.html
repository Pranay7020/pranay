    <pre ><!-- Preformatted text block -->
        This is a preformatted text block.
        It preserves whitespace and line breaks,
        making it ideal for displaying code or other
        text where formatting is important.
        Each line will appear exactly as written,
        including spaces and indentation.

        This is useful for showing examples of code,
        such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript,
